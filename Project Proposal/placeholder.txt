OBJECTIVE/PROBLEM (5 points)
Project Title:  Credit Approval Analysis
Background Information on chosen project topic: 
Accessing to credit is a key element in personal finance. During the last decade, with the widespread of internet and growth of technology, lenders are developing and optimizing machine learning models to minimize the risk of default and increase their ROI. 

Thus end user has been subject to certain "standard" in order to access those loans.

DATASET/PLAN FOR DATA (4 points)
Data Sources (links, attachments, etc.): 


Data Description (describe each of your data sources, include screenshots of a few rows of data): 
The main dataset is the Credit Approval dataset taken from the archives of the machine learning repository of the University of California. It contains data from credit card application. 
Key Variables: (which ones will be considered independent and dependent? Are you going to create new variables? What variables do you hypothesize beforehand to be most important?)
There are 15  independent variables in the dataset, including:
1.	Gender
2.	Age
3.	Debt
4.	Marital status
5.	Bank customer
6.	Educational level
7.	Ethnicity
8.	Years of employment
9.	Prior default
10.	Employed
11.	Credit Score
12.	Driver license
13.	Citizen
14.	Zip code
15.	Income 
There is one  dependent variable: Approved.

We are going to create dummy variables for all the category variables( gender,bank_customer,marital status,bank customer,prior default,employed,driver license)
For age,debt,education level,years of employment,ethnicity 




APPROACH/METHODOLOGY (8 points)
Planned Approach (In paragraph(s), describe the approach you will take and what are the models you will try to use? Mention any data transformations that would need to happen. How do you plan to compare your models? How do you plan to train and optimize your model hyper-parameters?))







Anticipated Conclusions/Hypothesis (what results do you expect, how will you approach lead you to determining the final conclusion of your analysis) Note: At the end of the project, you do not have to be correct or have acceptable accuracy, the purpose is to walk us through an analysis that gives the reader insight into the conclusion regarding your objective/problem statement




What business decisions will be impacted by the results of your analysis? What could be some benefits?
